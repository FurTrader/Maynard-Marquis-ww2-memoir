It was recorded on audio cassette in 1991 and I copied it to MP3 and CDs around 2012-ish. 
I edited the recording to remove background noise and unnessesary pauses.

From Maynard's self written obituary:

“…He graduated from Elyria High School in 1943 and immediately joined the U.S. Army. After basic training in Georgia he was sent to England and assigned to the 29th Infantry Division. His unit stormed Omaha Beach on D-Day - June 6, 1944. Maynard was wounded in the battle for St. Lo, France and returned to England to recuperate. In November of 1944 he returned to France and was assigned to the Supreme Headquarters American Expedition Forces where his assignment was to stop theft and black market activities in the U.S. Army. In June 1945 he was assigned the job of motorcycle courier in Northern France & Belgium. Maynard was part of the unit that stood guard for President Truman as he traveled through Antwerp, Belgium on his way to the Potsdam Conference in July of 1945. He returned to the states in January of 1946 and was honorably discharged at Indiantown Gap, PA, and immediately joined the Army Reserves for 3 years. Maynard was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Presidential Unit Citation, Combat Infantry Badge, French Freedom Medal and Good Conduct awards.”
